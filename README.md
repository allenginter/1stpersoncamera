This was an idea based on my misunderstanding of the limits of papyrus ;) 
Moving to an IMGUI form to accomplish this task

The IMGUI works in all but spirit :) Still have to figure out how to hook and Skyrim accept the chanegs it makes without forcing a reset state when you move from 1st to 3rd and back to 1st. Sort of on the back burner for now, but it will come to me.
